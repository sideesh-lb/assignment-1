	Your function should return the best solution found,

	1. The best maze found, which is a 2-dimensional numpy array.
	2. The energy of the best maze found.

	Note that you should make a local copy of the maze 
	before making any changes to it.

def HILLDESCENT_RANDOM_RESTART(maze, start_cell, goal_state, iterations, num_searches):
	'''
	Fill in this function to implement Hill Descent local search with Random Restarts.

	For a given number of searches (num_searches), run hill descent search.

	Keep track of the best solution through all restarts, and return that.

	Your function should return the best solution found, 
	which should be a tuple containing 2 elements:

	1. The best maze found, which is a 2-dimensional numpy array.
	2. The energy of the best maze found.

	Note that you should make a local copy of the maze 
	before making any changes to it.

	You will also need to keep a separate copy of the original maze
	to use when restarting the algorithm each time.

	If using print statements to debug, please make sure
	to remove them before your final submisison.
