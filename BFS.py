    '''
    Fill in this function that uses Breadth First Search to find the shortest path 
    from the start state to the goal state.
    
    Return the matrix (a 2-dimensional numpy array) of shortest path 
    distances from the start cell to each cell. 
    
    If no path exists from the start state to a given cell, that cell should be assigned -1.
    
    The start state should be assigned a path lenght of 0.
    
    If using print statements to debug, please make sure 
    to remove them before your final submisison.
